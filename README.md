 Simple, customizable calendar for your app!


## Installing

###### CocoaPods:
    
   	platform :ios, '10.0'
	use_frameworks!

	target '<Your Target Name>' do
    	pod 'Alamofire', '~> 4.5'
	end

#### Setup

Simply add `UIView` on the `ViewController` and subclass it as `CalendarView`

In the ViewController connect view using IBOutlet

After that in viewDidLoad() simply set delegate, current date and ... that's all! You have fully working calendar ðŸ˜Ž

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        calendarView.delegate = self
        
        let today = Date()
